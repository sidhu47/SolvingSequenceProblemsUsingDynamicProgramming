# This project uses dynamic programming algorithms LCS and Levenshtein distance to solve sequence probles
 - LCS is applied on 100 genome sequences to find lcs among all the possible combination between two strings in given set of 100 genome sequences
 - Levenshtein distance is applied on 50 words for each alphabet where string lenght of each word varies from 4 to 6 to keep it simple.

# Results
 - **LCS:** It took 10 seconds to find all the possible LCS between two strings amond 100 genome sequences.
 - **Levenshtein distance:** It took less than 1 second for given dictionary to get the dictionary word recommendations.
